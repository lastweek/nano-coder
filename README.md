# Nano-Coder

Nano-Coder is a terminal-first coding agent for working directly inside an existing repository. It combines an OpenAI-compatible LLM client with local tools, slash commands, skills, MCP integrations, delegated subagents, and per-session logs so you can see exactly what happened during each turn.

It is built for practical repo work rather than chat demos: inspect files, edit code, run commands, load focused instructions only when needed, hand off isolated subtasks, and keep long sessions usable with context compaction.

## Why Nano-Coder

- Work where the code already is: your shell, your repo, your files
- Keep the agent observable with a live activity feed and structured logs
- Extend behavior with local skills and MCP servers instead of giant prompts
- Delegate parallel subtasks without mixing child work into the main context
- Stay productive in longer sessions with context inspection and compaction

## What You Get

- Built-in tools for `read_file`, `write_file`, `run_command`, `load_skill`, and `run_subagent`
- Streaming terminal UX with live activity updates while the model is thinking
- Slash commands for tools, skills, MCP servers, plans, subagents, and context usage
- Local `SKILL.md` bundles with discovery, pinning, and on-demand loading
- MCP support so external tools appear beside built-in tools
- Subagents with isolated contexts, nested logs, and bounded concurrency
- Per-session logging under `logs/` with human-readable and structured outputs
- Planning workflow via `/plan`
- Automatic and manual context compaction for long-running sessions

## Quickstart

### 1. Install

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

The git hook path enables the local secret guard so obvious credentials do not get committed by accident.

### 2. Configure

```bash
cp config.yaml.example config.yaml
cp .env.example .env
```

`config.yaml` is the main project config. Use `.env` for secrets and machine-local overrides. Environment variables override values from `config.yaml`.

Minimal OpenAI-compatible configuration:

```yaml
llm:
  provider: custom
  model: your-model-name
  base_url: https://api.example.com/v1
  api_key: your-api-key
```

You can also use `openai`, `azure`, or `ollama` provider modes.

### 3. Run

```bash
python -m src.main
```

Alternative entrypoint:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

## What It Looks Like

Agent >
  • LLM call 1 requested 2 tools
  • Tool finished: run_command(cmd='rg "SessionLogger" -n src') (0.03s)
  • Tool finished: read_file(file_path='src/logger.py') (0.00s)
  • LLM call 2 produced final answer

Nano-Coder writes one session directory per CLI run, with session.json for
metadata, llm.log for the execution timeline, and events.jsonl for structured
events.

## Core Ideas

### Tools

Nano-Coder uses the same tool-calling loop for built-in tools and MCP-provided tools. The default repo-workflow set covers reading files, writing files, running shell commands, loading skills, and delegating child tasks.

### Skills

Skills are local instruction bundles stored in `SKILL.md`. Nano-Coder keeps a compact skill catalog in context and loads full skill bodies only when they are pinned, explicitly requested with `$skill-name`, or loaded through the `load_skill` tool.

Discovery roots:

- `.nano-coder/skills`
- `~/.nano-coder/skills`

### MCP

MCP servers are configured in `config.yaml` and initialized at startup. Their tools are registered into the same tool system as built-in tools, so the model can use them through the same request loop and you can inspect them with `/mcp`.

### Subagents

Subagents let the main agent delegate isolated repo tasks to fresh child agents. They do not inherit the full conversation history, they write nested logs, and they run with bounded parallelism.

### Context Compaction

Long sessions can compact older turns into a rolling summary while keeping recent turns in raw form. You can inspect the current estimate with `/context` and manage compaction with `/compact`.

### Logging

Every CLI run gets a session directory under `logs/`:

- `session.json` for session metadata and aggregate counts
- `llm.log` for the full human-readable execution timeline
- `events.jsonl` for the structured event stream
- `artifacts/` for spilled large payloads
- `subagents/` for nested child-agent logs

Convenience symlinks are also maintained at `logs/latest-session` and `logs/latest.log`.

## Common Commands

- `/help` to list commands
- `/tool` to inspect available tools
- `/skill` to list, pin, clear, inspect, and reload skills
- `/mcp` to inspect configured MCP servers and tools
- `/context` to estimate the next-call baseline context payload
- `/compact` to inspect or trigger compaction behavior
- `/subagent` to inspect or run delegated child tasks
- `/plan` to enter planning mode, draft a plan, and apply it

Each command also supports built-in help such as `/command help`, `/command --help`, and `/command -h`.

## Configuration

Nano-Coder uses three configuration sources:

- `config.yaml` for primary local configuration
- `.env` for secrets and machine-local values
- environment variables for explicit overrides

Useful settings to know early:

- `ui.enable_streaming`
- `agent.max_iterations`
- `logging.enabled`
- `logging.async_mode`
- `logging.log_dir`
- `subagents.max_parallel`
- `subagents.max_per_turn`
- `context.auto_compact`
- `plan.enabled`

`logging.async_mode` routes session-log writes through a background transport while keeping the same on-disk log format. `subagents.max_parallel` caps concurrent child-agent threads independently from the per-turn delegation limit.

Example MCP config:

```yaml
mcp:
  servers:
    - name: deepwiki
      url: https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp
      enabled: true
      timeout: 30
```

See [config.yaml.example](config.yaml.example) for the full example file.

## Documentation

The front page stays focused on setup and concepts. Deeper implementation details live in `docs/`:

- [docs/design-overview.md](docs/design-overview.md) for architecture and the main ReAct loop
- [docs/subagents.md](docs/subagents.md) for delegated child-agent execution
- [docs/skills.md](docs/skills.md) for skill discovery and loading
- [docs/context-compaction.md](docs/context-compaction.md) for compaction strategy and lifecycle

## Development

Install dev dependencies and run tests:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest
```
